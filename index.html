                  I Received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were

                  looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
                  amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                  found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                  weeks was the best-and most grueling- time of my life. Since
                  completing the course. I've successfully switched careers, working as
                  a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                  "Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I
                  needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                  programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
                  The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                  hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. THe agile team
                  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to The
                  next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In face, I've
                  often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development
                  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
                  developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended!."
